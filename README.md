## My Font Icons
----------
This is my fonticons repository. In the master branch, I use **Fontello**.


### How to use
Include the css/fontello.css in your html pages. It will find the fonts in font/ directory and use them.

To use an icon, you can use `<i class="icon-'iconname'"></i>` which iconname is your icon name. For example: `<i class="icon-tag"></i>`.
